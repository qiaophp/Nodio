# Nodio roadmap — 100% aardio source compatibility, x64 first

Decisions locked with the project owner:

1. **Retire the MFC shell.** The official aardio IDE is an MFC application
   (confirmed via RTTI imports of the original `aardio.exe`). Rebuilding
   that shell in C++/MFC is the largest failure mode of the previous
   reconstruction: instead, the VM engine is extracted MFC-free (this
   repo), and the IDE will be re-built on **WTL + Scintilla** (Phase 3).
2. **x64 first, x86 retained for legacy DLL authors.** All new FFI work
   targets the unified Microsoft x64 ABI. The Win32 build stays available
   only because some legacy 32-bit-only third-party DLLs can never load
   into a 64-bit process (OS-level restriction).
3. **Publisher rebuilt in Phase 2** on top of this engine: binary-safe
   resource embedding (no UTF-8 re-encoding of PNG/ICO/DLL payloads),
   `.aproj` embed/ignored/local semantics, PE icon/version/manifest/UAC
   stamping, publish-time syntax gate. The old `AardioPublish.cpp`
   (43 MFC references) stays behind in the reference tree as evidence,
   it is not carried over.
4. **Compatibility boundary** (honest ledger):
   - 100%: aardio source language, official source-written stdlib, all
     Windows native API calls, `.aproj` project format, DSG form layout.
   - OS-physical limits: third-party **32-bit-only native DLLs** (run via
     a published x86 build), and closed pre-compiled `=aardio` bytecode
     blobs (original opcode encodings remain unrecovered).

## Phase 1 — engine (this repo)
- [x] Tree-walking interpreter, 52-test regression suite green (x86 + x64)
- [x] MFC-free extraction (`engine/` + console `host/`)
- [x] x64 callback trampoline rewrite (shadow-slot spill + XMM save,
      RCX=ctx contract) — fixes the 0xC0000005 in EnumChildWindows-style
      callbacks
- [x] x64 per-signature JIT call stubs — float/double params now reach
      XMM0..XMM3 (`pow/fabs/sqrt` acceptance verified); float returns
      bit-cast from RAX
- [x] x64 struct `cbSize` auto-sync (WNDCLASSEX 48→80) + dangling-pointer
      fix in `StructSerialize`
- [x] UTF-8 byte-string value model (`#s` = bytes, `s[1]` = byte code)
- [x] Real-library import gate: `win`, `win.ui`, `gdi`, `gdip`, `sqlite`,
      `JSON` parse clean end-to-end
- [x] x64 `winform.add` named-argument table (`name={cls;text;left;top;
      right;bottom}`) — was a 7-positional-arg signature that crashed x64
- [x] `arg` varargs binding (the engine bound `...` only) + empty-varargs
      reads as null so `if(!...)` recursion guards terminate
- [x] Memory DLL loading: `$"path"` binary inline + manual PE mapper
      (TLS callbacks unsupported, matching aardio's own limitation)

## Phase 2 — publisher (this repo, `publish/`)
- [x] Binary-safe payload embedder + `.aproj` embed/ignored/local rules
- [x] PE stamping: icon / version info / DPI-aware manifest / UAC
- [x] Publish-time syntax gate + dependency closure for `lib/`
- [x] Publish fixtures (`tests/m7/proj`, t49) + memory-DLL-from-payload
      assertions (x64 + x86 green)

## Phase 3 — IDE shell (`ide/`, WTL + Scintilla)
- [ ] Tabbed MDI frame, docking panes (project tree / output console)
- [ ] Scintilla integrated with a custom aardio lexer (UTF-8 native)
- [ ] Real-time run/debug output plumbing over the `NODIO_*` contract

## Phase 4 — visual form designer (`designer/`)
- [ ] Native HWND design canvas + 8-handle resize tracker
- [ ] DSG `/*DSG{{*/ ... /*}}*/` round-trip parser/serializer
- [ ] Toolbox + property grid
